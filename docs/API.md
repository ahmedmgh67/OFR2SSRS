# Oracle2SSRS — HTTP API Reference

All endpoints live under the Flask app in `backend/app.py` and listen on
`http://127.0.0.1:5057` by default (override with the `PORT` env var).

* All responses are JSON unless explicitly noted (the `.rdl` download
  returns `application/xml`, the bundle and burst-pack downloads return
  `application/zip`).
* The server keeps the **most recent successful conversion** in a
  process-local cache so `GET /api/download/rdl` and
  `GET /api/download/bundle` work without re-running the pipeline.
  Restarting the process clears the cache.

---

## Error format

Every endpoint that can fail returns the same shape:

```json
{
  "error": "human-readable message",
  "trace": "full Python traceback as a string (debug only)"
}
```

with HTTP status `400` for client errors (missing file, malformed payload)
and `500` for everything else. The `trace` field is only populated when
`FLASK_DEBUG=1`, but is always present on the exception path because the
backend runs in `debug=True` for development.

---

## `GET /`

Renders `frontend/templates/index.html`. The template receives a
`samples` list (file names from `samples/oracle/*.xml`) so the dropdown
can be populated server-side.

No JSON. Returns `text/html`.

---

## `POST /api/convert`

Convert a single uploaded Oracle Reports artifact.

**Request** (`multipart/form-data`)

| Field | Type | Required | Notes                                       |
|-------|------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| file  | file | yes      | A `.xml` or `.rdf` Oracle Reports artifact. |
| label_overrides | JSON string | no | `{"<textbox name>"\|"title": "new text"}`. Replaces generated **literal labels** only — data expressions are never touched. The available names ship back in every payload as `overridable_labels`. |

**Curl**

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@samples/oracle/SAMPLE_INSPECTION.xml" \
     http://127.0.0.1:5057/api/convert

# with a label override
curl -X POST -F "file=@samples/oracle/SAMPLE_INSPECTION.xml" \
     -F 'label_overrides={"title":"Quarterly Contacts List"}' \
     http://127.0.0.1:5057/api/convert
```

**Response 200** — the standard conversion payload (see
"Conversion payload" below).

**Response 400** — `{"error": "no file uploaded"}` if the `file` field is
missing.

**Response 500** — `{"error": "...", "trace": "..."}` for any pipeline
exception.

---

## `POST /api/convert-bundle`

Convert a heterogeneous folder upload. Pass any number of files under the
form field `files`; the backend uses `converter/ingest.py` to classify
each by content (`primary_xml`, `rdf_binary`, `sql_files`, `docs`,
`screenshots`, `unknown`) and runs whatever subset of the pipeline is
feasible.

**Request** (`multipart/form-data`)

| Field | Type            | Required | Notes                              |
|-------|-----------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| files | file (multiple) | yes      | Repeat the field per file uploaded |

**Curl**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "files=@samples/oracle/SAMPLE_INSPECTION.xml" \
  -F "files=@notes/queries.docx" \
  -F "files=@notes/screenshots.docx" \
  http://127.0.0.1:5057/api/convert-bundle
```

**Response 200** — the standard conversion payload **plus** an
`ingest_report` key listing which files fell into which classification
bucket. When no Oracle XML is present, `report` is omitted and
`ingest_report` explains what was found so the UI can guide the user.

**Response 400** — `{"error": "no files uploaded"}`.

---

## `POST /api/convert-sample/<name>`

Run the converter against one of the bundled samples (anything in
`samples/oracle/*.xml`). The `<name>` segment is validated against the
samples dir to prevent path traversal.

**Curl**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5057/api/convert-sample/SAMPLE_INSPECTION.xml
```

**Response 200** — same conversion payload as `/api/convert`.

**Response 404** — sample not found.

---

## `POST /api/compare`

Structured diff between two uploaded Oracle Reports artifacts. Returns
parameter / dataset / formula / layout deltas plus a complexity-score
delta.

**Request** (`multipart/form-data`)

| Field | Type | Required | Notes                  |
|-------|------|----------|------------------------|
| a     | file | yes      | First report (Oracle). |
| b     | file | yes      | Second report.         |

**Response 200** — JSON with `diff` and `complexity` keys (see
`converter/compare.py` for the exact shape).

---

## `GET /api/download/rdl`

Streams the most recently generated RDL as a downloadable file.

* Filename: `<report.name>.rdl` (falls back to `report.rdl`).
* MIME: `application/xml`.
* Source: the in-memory `_LAST` cache, populated by the most recent
  successful `POST /api/convert*` call.

**Response 404** — no RDL has been generated yet in this process.

---

## `GET /api/download/bundle`

Streams a `.zip` containing the most recent RDL plus the full conversion
artifacts: validation report, deploy checklist, audit trail, AI prompts,
Burst Pack (if bursting was detected), and a README explaining what's
inside.

* MIME: `application/zip`.
* Filename: `<report.name>_bundle.zip` (falls back to `report_bundle.zip`).

---

## `GET /api/mockup/<variant>`

Returns a standalone HTML mockup variant. `<variant>` is one of:

* `print` — print-friendly black-and-white version with page breaks.
* `compact` — compact one-page summary view.

MIME: `text/html`.

---

## `POST /api/burst-preview`

Re-generates the Burst Pack files for the last-converted report with the
Distribution Settings the UI sends (every key is a `burst.config.json`
key; `report_server_url` is split into `ReportServer` + folder paths).

**Request** (`application/json`)

```json
{ "config_overrides": { "Deliver": "file", "OutputRoot": "C:\\Burst\\out",
                       "report_server_url": "http://host/ReportServer?/Folder" } }
```

**Response 200**

```json
{
  "bind_parameter":            "P_O2S_BURST_KEY",
  "filter_injected":           true,
  "filename_pattern_normalized": "<Permit>_{date:yyyyMMdd}.pdf",
  "powershell_script":         "<Run-Burst.ps1>",
  "email_config_template":     "<burst.config.json>",
  "burst_list_rdl":            "<the key-list RDL>",
  "burst_list_sql":            "SELECT DISTINCT ... AS BURST_KEY ...",
  "readme":                    "...",
  "service_account_checklist": [{ "step": 1, "title": "...", "body": "..." }]
}
```

---

## `POST /api/download/burst-pack`

Streams the Burst Pack `.zip` for the current conversion: `<Report>.rdl`
(with the hidden `P_O2S_BURST_KEY` filter parameter), `<Report>_BurstList.rdl`,
`Run-Burst.ps1`, `burst.config.json`, `README.md`, `service-account-setup.md`.
Takes the same `config_overrides` body as `/api/burst-preview`.

MIME: `application/zip`.

---

## `GET /api/subreports`

Lists drill-through child reports detected from the parent report's
formulas and layout references.

**Response 200**

```json
{
  "children": [
    {
      "name":           "CHILD_REPORT_A",
      "param_mapping":  {"P_KEY": "Fields!Key.Value"},
      "artifacts":      ["CHILD_REPORT_A.xml"],
      "ready":          true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## `POST /api/subreport/<child>/upload`

Attach Oracle XML / SQL / DOCX artifacts to a child report. Multipart
form upload identical in shape to `/api/convert-bundle`.

## `POST /api/subreport/<child>/clear`

Clear all artifacts attached to a child report.

## `POST /api/subreport/<child>/build`

Run the converter pipeline against the artifacts attached to a child
report and return the conversion payload for that child.

---

## `POST /api/run-query`

Execute translated T-SQL against `backend/db/sample.sqlite`. The bridge
layer in `preview/live_data.py` rewrites a few T-SQL constructs for
SQLite and registers Python UDFs for the `dbo.fn_*` package stubs.

**Request** (`application/json`)

```json
{
  "sql":        "SELECT TOP 10 ITEM_NO FROM ITEM WHERE YEAR = @P_YEAR",
  "parameters": {"P_YEAR": 2024}
}
```

| Field      | Type   | Required | Notes                                            |
|------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| sql        | string | yes      | Translated T-SQL; `@P_FOO` binds are supported.  |
| parameters | object | no       | Map of bind name (without `@`) to value.         |

**Response 200**

```json
{
  "rows":     [["I-001", "Acme Inc."], ["I-002", "Beta LLC"]],
  "columns":  ["ITEM_NO", "ENTITY_NAME"],
  "warnings": ["GETDATE() rewritten to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for SQLite"]
}
```

`rows` is row-major; values are JSON primitives (strings, numbers, null).

**Response 500** — `{"error": "...", "trace": "..."}` on any SQL error.

---

## `GET /api/ai/status`

Reports whether the optional Claude assist is configured.

**Response 200**

```json
{ "configured": true, "model": "claude-..." }
```

`configured` is `true` when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in the process
environment (or loaded from `.env` at startup).

## `GET /api/ai/test`

Sends a trivial probe to the Anthropic API to confirm the key is valid.

## `POST /api/auto-fix`

Iterates every AI prompt in the current conversion, calls Claude once
per prompt, validates the response, and patches the RDL in place.

## `POST /api/apply-fix`

Applies one manually-pasted UDF body back into the RDL.

---

## `GET /api/recent/clear`

Clears the in-memory recent-conversion cache. Useful in development when
you want to reset state without restarting the process.

---

## `GET /api/health`

Cheap probe used by the UI on page load.

**Response 200**

```json
{
  "ok":      true,
  "samples": ["SAMPLE_INSPECTION.xml"]
}
```

---

## Conversion payload

The shape returned by every successful `/api/convert*` call:

```json
{
  "report":              { ParsedReport.to_dict() },
  "rdl_xml":             "<Report ...>...</Report>",
  "oracle_xml":          "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>...",
  "mockup_html":         "<!doctype html>...",
  "validation_issues":   [ ValidationIssue, ... ],
  "deployment_checklist":[ ChecklistItem,    ... ],
  "preflight":           { "verdict": "READY|AMBER|RED|BLOCKER",
                           "issues": [ { "severity", "rule", "message" } ] },
  "fidelity_report":     { "score": 1.0, "summary": "...",
                           "categories": { ... }, "needs_attention": [ ... ] },
  "overridable_labels":  [ { "name": "Tb_PageTitle",
                             "text": "Grant Status",
                             "region": "page_header" }, ... ],
  "bursting":            { ... },
  "subreports":          { ... },
  "audit_trail":         [ AuditEntry, ... ],
  "ai_prompts":          [ ... ]
}
```

`preflight.verdict` is the deployment gate; `fidelity_report.score` is
`1.0` when nothing was silently dropped, and
`fidelity_report.categories.layout_fields.display_coverage` is the
stricter "how much of the layout actually displays" ratio. Whenever
either fidelity axis is below full coverage, `preflight.issues[]` also
carries one `severity: "INFO"` finding (rule `fidelity.needs_attention`)
naming the measured numbers, so the preflight surface and the fidelity
card always tell one story; INFO findings never change the verdict. See
the [run guide](RUN_GUIDE.md) for what each verdict and rule means.

### `validation_issues[]` — `ValidationIssue`

```json
{
  "severity": "error",
  "line":     12,
  "col":      8,
  "message":  "Outer-join (+) syntax not supported in T-SQL",
  "rule":     "OUTER_JOIN_PLUS",
  "scope":    "Q_MAIN",
  "excerpt":  "WHERE p.fac_id = f.id (+)"
}
```

`line`, `col`, and `excerpt` may be `null` when the issue is report-wide
rather than at a specific source location.

### `deployment_checklist[]` — `ChecklistItem`

```json
{
  "step":   "Point the DataSource at your target SQL Server",
  "status": "todo",
  "detail": "Open the .rdl in Report Builder, edit the shared DataSource reference, point it at your shared DS."
}
```

`status` is one of `auto` (already done), `todo` (user must perform),
`manual` (UI work the converter cannot automate), `caution` (a known
footgun the user should read carefully).

---

## JSON contract for `ParsedReport`

This is the `report` key in the conversion payload. Top-level shape:

```json
{
  "name":            "SAMPLE_INSPECTION",
  "dtd_version":     "9.0.4.0.33",
  "parameters":      [ ReportParameter, ... ],
  "queries":         [ DataQuery,       ... ],
  "formulas":        [ FormulaColumn,   ... ],
  "layout":          [ LayoutGroup,     ... ],
  "triggers":        [ TriggerCode,     ... ],
  "embedded_images": [ { "id": "image_1", "mime_type": "image/gif", "size": 2048 }, ... ],
  "warnings":        [ "string", ...    ]
}
```

`embedded_images` lists any seal / logo / watermark blobs extracted from the
Oracle layout's `<binaryData>` (the raw hex is omitted from the JSON; `size`
is the decoded byte length). These are emitted into the RDL's
`<EmbeddedImages>` block.

### `ReportParameter`

```json
{
  "name":          "P_YEAR",
  "label":         "Year",
  "datatype":      "number",
  "width":         4,
  "precision":     0,
  "initial_value": "2024",
  "input_mask":    null,
  "display":       true
}
```

* `datatype` is the original Oracle datatype (`character`, `number`, `date`).
* The SSRS datatype is derived in code via the `ssrs_datatype` property on
  the dataclass: character to `String`, number to `Integer`,
  date to `DateTime`.
* `display: false` indicates an internal-only parameter, which the RDL
  generator marks `<Hidden>true</Hidden>`.

### `DataQuery`

```json
{
  "name":  "Q_MAIN",
  "sql":   "SELECT id, name FROM item WHERE year = :P_YEAR",
  "tsql":  "SELECT id, name FROM item WHERE year = @P_YEAR",
  "items": [ DataItem, ... ],
  "notes": [ "Replaced :P_YEAR with @P_YEAR", ... ]
}
```

* `sql` is the original Oracle SQL as parsed.
* `tsql` is the translator's output. Empty before the translator runs.
* `notes` is the per-query translation audit log.

### `DataItem`

```json
{
  "name":       "Item",
  "expression": "i.item_no",
  "datatype":   "vchar2",
  "width":      30,
  "label":      "Item #"
}
```

### `FormulaColumn`

```json
{
  "name":         "CF_File",
  "return_type":  "VARCHAR2",
  "plsql_body":   "RETURN :item_no || '-' || :year;",
  "tsql_body":    "RETURN @item_no + '-' + CAST(@year AS VARCHAR);",
  "notes":        [ "Concatenation rewritten || -> +" ],
  "agg_function": "",
  "agg_source":   "",
  "agg_scope":    ""
}
```

* `plsql_body` is the original Oracle PL/SQL.
* `tsql_body` is the translator's best-effort SQL rendering of the body.
  Separately, the RDL generator compiles `CF_*` / `CP_*` formula columns
  into inline SSRS VB.NET expressions (see `translators/plsql_formula.py`).
* `agg_function` / `agg_source` / `agg_scope` are populated when the
  "formula" is actually an Oracle `<summary>` (a count / sum / avg total),
  carrying the aggregate function, the column being aggregated, and the
  reset/compute scope. They are empty strings for ordinary formulas.

### `LayoutGroup`

```json
{
  "name":         "G_MAIN",
  "source_query": "Q_MAIN",
  "fields":       [ LayoutField, ... ],
  "children":     [ LayoutGroup,  ... ]
}
```

`children` recurses, mirroring the Oracle repeating-frame nesting.

### `LayoutField`

```json
{
  "name":      "F_Item",
  "source":    "Item",
  "text":      "",
  "bold":      true,
  "font_size": 10,
  "x":         0.0,
  "y":         0.5,
  "width":     2.0,
  "height":    0.25
}
```

* `source` references either a `DataItem.name` or `FormulaColumn.name`.
* `text` is non-empty for boilerplate (static label) fields.
* `x` / `y` / `width` / `height` are inches.

### `TriggerCode`

```json
{
  "name": "BeforeReport",
  "body": "/* PL/SQL */"
}
```

Triggers are surfaced in the UI's side-by-side view and as audit-trail
entries; they are not auto-translated (most have no SSRS analog).

### `warnings[]`

Top-level parser warnings (`"unparseable <foo> at line 12"`, etc.). Per-query
translation warnings live on the individual `DataQuery.notes`.
