# Oracle2SSRS — Coworker Demo (5 minutes)

## Why this matters (30 seconds)

We have **hundreds of Oracle Reports** still in production. Every one of them
has to move to SSRS before the Oracle support contract expires.

Doing it by hand:

* Re-type every parameter into Report Builder.
* Read every PL/SQL formula column and re-write it in T-SQL.
* Rebuild every repeating frame as a Tablix.
* Re-validate the layout against an old Oracle screenshot.
* Hit "Define Query Parameters" 14 times every time anyone opens the
  report in Report Builder.

Realistic estimate from the team: **40 to 200 hours per report.** At our
volume that is 2-3 FTE-years of pure migration drudgery.

This tool turns the bulk of it into **30 seconds of drag-and-drop**, plus a
short, well-defined list of things a human still needs to clean up. The
human time per report drops to 2-8 hours.

## 5-minute live demo flow

You're going to walk through this in front of the laptop. Don't read off the
script — just hit each beat.

### Beat 1: open the app (15 seconds)

```bash
cd HackathonOracle2SSRS
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt   # ONE-TIME on a fresh clone; the launcher never installs
./run.sh        # or run.bat on Windows
```

Browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5057`. Show the empty drag-drop zone.
(If the launcher prints "a required Python package is not installed", the
one-time line above was skipped — run it, then launch again.)

> "This runs locally. No data leaves the machine. No accounts, no API keys
> required."

### Beat 2: drop the Oracle XML (30 seconds)

Drag a sample Oracle Reports XML onto the drop zone (anything in
`samples/oracle/` works).

While the spinner runs (it won't run for long), say:

> "An Oracle Reports XML is around 1,000-2,000 lines of XML for a typical
> report. Parameters, datasets, formula columns, a master-detail layout,
> a footer with page numbers. We parse all of that into a single in-memory
> dataclass, then run the translator and generator off that."

When the tabs light up, you have everything you need open at once.

### Beat 3: the Preview tab (30 seconds)

This is the first of four main tabs.

> "This is the generated RDL rendered by Microsoft's own ReportViewer
> engine — real pages, real pagination, not an approximation. An instant
> HTML mockup stands in for a second while the engine works, then the
> real render swaps in. You can eyeball it against the original Oracle
> output before you ever open Report Builder."

If the source is a per-record report (letter, certificate, invoice) you
see one card per row. If it's tabular, you see a grouped grid. The
generator picks the right body shape automatically.

### Beat 4: the RDL XML tab (45 seconds)

Click the **RDL XML** tab.

> "This is a real, structurally valid SSRS 2008+ RDL document. It opens
> in Report Builder with no parse errors. Every Oracle parameter became
> an SSRS ReportParameter with the right datatype. Every Oracle dataSource
> became an SSRS DataSet. Every repeating frame became a Tablix."

Scroll through it briefly. Don't try to read it — it's not the point.
Then pause and call out one thing:

> "Notice the DataSources block. We emit it as a `DataSourceReference`
> pointing at a placeholder name, not an embedded connection string.
> This is load-bearing — it's the difference between SSRS popping the
> 'Define Query Parameters' dialog at every Refresh Fields and the
> report just working. The user repoints the reference at their actual
> shared DS once post-upload, and from then on it's silent."

### Beat 5: the Bursting tab (45 seconds)

Click **Bursting**.

> "Lots of legacy Oracle Reports were used for per-recipient distribution
> — one PDF per customer, per facility, per district. Oracle had a
> bursting feature for this. SSRS has Data-Driven Subscriptions, but
> only on Enterprise SKU."

If the sample triggered bursting detection:

> "We detect the bursting pattern from the source's own distribution
> declarations -- the file-name formula and the per-record destination.
> Here's the burst key we derived and the file name pattern. Download the
> Burst Pack and you get the report with one hidden per-key filter
> parameter, a companion key-list report, and `Run-Burst.ps1`: it asks the
> report server for the key list, renders the report once per key through
> URL access, and saves each file under the Oracle name. Nothing installed
> anywhere -- you can try it from your own PC with `-DryRun`. Enterprise
> shops can paste the key-list SQL into a native Data-Driven Subscription."

If the sample didn't trigger bursting, just say:

> "When the source report has per-recipient distribution, this tab fills
> in. The detection is name-agnostic — it reads the distribution
> instructions the source declares, not a list of column names we hope to
> recognise. When the source declares no recipient, the query says so
> instead of guessing. The Burst Pack is downloadable as a separate zip."

### Beat 6: the Sub-Reports tab (30 seconds)

Click **Sub-Reports**.

> "If the parent report drills through to child reports (a list view that
> links to a detail view, for example), we detect those and let you
> upload each child's Oracle XML right here. Click Build and you get an
> RDL for the child generated by the same pipeline."

### Beat 7: the Advanced views (60 seconds)

Click the **Advanced views** toggle to expose the rest of the tabs.

- **Side-by-Side.** "Auditors love this. Original Oracle XML on the
  left, converted RDL on the right. You can see exactly which Oracle
  construct produced which RDL element."
- **Live Data.** "We bundle a SQLite sample DB and run the translated
  T-SQL against it. Real rows come back. Reviewers see the migration is
  functional, not just textually plausible, before we touch a real SQL
  Server."
- **Validation.** "Two validators run automatically. T-SQL static
  validator catches untranslated Oracle constructs. RDL structural
  validator confirms every field reference resolves to a declared field
  and every parameter reference resolves to a declared parameter.
  Errors here mean Report Builder will reject the file — we want zero."
- **Deploy Checklist.** "Once you download the RDL, this is the punch
  list. Items marked `auto` the converter already did. `todo` is what
  you have to do and we tell you exactly how. `caution` is a known
  footgun. `manual` is UI work nothing can automate."
- **Extras.** "Translation audit trail, AI prompt templates, and — if
  you set an Anthropic API key in `.env` — a button that calls Claude
  on every prompt automatically and patches the results back into the
  RDL."

### Beat 8: download and open in Report Builder (45 seconds)

Click **Download .rdl** (or **Download Bundle** for the full zip). Open
the RDL in Report Builder live.

> "Opens clean, no parse errors. Parameters are there with the right
> types. Datasets are wired. The Tablix is laid out. Now I repoint the
> data source at our shared DS — and I do NOT click Refresh Fields;
> the field list is emitted complete, so there is nothing to refresh —
> save, view, export to PDF. That's the loop."

That's the demo. Stop here.

## What we still need to do by hand (be honest)

We do **not** want to oversell this. The tool nails the structural 80% and
deliberately surfaces what is left.

### 1. Lexical references (`&LEX_FOO`)

Oracle's lexical-reference feature splices arbitrary text into the SQL at
runtime. There is no clean SSRS analog. The translator leaves them in
place; the validator flags them as errors; the checklist tells the human
how to convert them to RDL expressions. **Expect 30-60 minutes per
lexical reference**, depending on what it does.

### 2. PL/SQL package function bodies (`Pkg_Foo.fn_Bar`)

We rewrite the **call site** to `dbo.fn_Bar` and ship a stub, but the
**body** of the function has to be ported by hand into a real SQL Server
scalar UDF. The audit trail flags every package call so nothing gets
missed. **Plan on a one-time porting investment per package** — once
you've ported a common package, every report that uses it is free.

### 3. Pixel-precise layout

We translate position, font weight, and font size, but Oracle Reports'
layout model has anchors and per-frame spacing rules SSRS doesn't share.
Reviewers should expect to nudge a few text boxes in Report Builder.
**Plan 30-90 minutes of layout polish per report.**

### 4. Triggers

Most Oracle triggers (`BeforeReport`, `AfterParameterForm`, ...) have no
SSRS analog. We expose the trigger bodies in the side-by-side view; the
human decides whether the logic belongs in the dataset, in a parameter
default, or whether it can be dropped.

### 5. The `.rdf` binary format

We accept `.rdf` files and pull out the embedded XML payload, but the
binary layout/font tables are not parsed. **For best results, export the
report as XML from Reports Builder before feeding it in.**

## If you have 30 more seconds

Mention these in passing:

* The whole pipeline is **decoupled** behind one `ParsedReport` dataclass.
  Adding a new generator (CSV, Power BI, Crystal) means writing one
  function. Adding a new translator (LLM-assisted, DB2-target) means
  writing one function.
* **PL/SQL formula columns are actually compiled**, not hand-waved. A real
  tokenizer + parser turns a `CF_*` / `CP_*` formula into an SSRS VB.NET
  expression that computes inline. If a formula calls an external package
  function we can't resolve, we leave a safe placeholder instead of
  shipping a broken expression.
* **Verified, not asserted.** The generated RDL is validated against
  Microsoft's own RDL 2008 XSD, and render-verified through Microsoft's
  ReportViewer engine (`tools/renderlab`) — it renders to a real PDF that
  we measure for page count and blank pages. The test suite is **1,377
  passed, 0 failed** (20 environment-gated skips).
* It is **offline by default**. No SaaS, no telemetry, no API keys
  required. Optional Claude assist is opt-in via `.env`.
* The frontend is **vanilla JS** with no build step. You can clone and
  run it in 60 seconds on a fresh laptop.

Then stop talking and let them play with it.
