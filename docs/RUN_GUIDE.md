# Oracle2SSRS — Deployment Run Guide

A step-by-step operator's guide for running the converter, reading its
verdicts, and deploying the output to a SQL Server Reporting Services
(SSRS) Report Server. Written for an agency/enterprise deployment where
the person converting reports may not be the person who wrote them.

---

## 1. Install

Requirements: **Python 3.10+** on Windows, macOS, or Linux. (The optional
render-verification harness is Windows-only; conversion itself runs
anywhere.)

```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-clone-url>
cd <repo>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use the bundled scripts: `setup.ps1` (Windows) / `setup.sh` (POSIX).

### Optional: local render verification (RenderLab)

`tools/renderlab` renders generated RDLs through **Microsoft's own
ReportViewer engine** and measures the PDFs. It needs Windows + the .NET
ReportViewer assemblies (fetched by the tool on first run). If your
environment blocks unsigned executables, the harness automatically falls
back to a signed-DLL render path; conversion quality is identical either
way — only local proof-rendering is affected.

---

## 2. Run the app

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000`. The single-page app serves from
`frontend/`. Everything runs locally — no report content leaves the
machine.

---

## 3. Convert a report

1. **Export the report from Oracle** as XML:
   `rwconverter userid=... source=REPORT.rdf dest=REPORT.xml dtype=XMLFILE`
   (Reports Builder's *File → Generate to File → XML* works too.)
   The converter also accepts `.jsp` Reports Web Sources, raw `.sql`
   files, `.docx` walkthroughs, and mixed folders of artifacts.
2. **Drag the file(s) into the app** (or POST to `/api/convert` — see
   `docs/API.md`). No source at hand? Click a **Try a sample** chip in the
   sidebar — two synthetic reports ship with the app, including
   `SAMPLE_FEE_NOTICE`, which shows off an in-report **action button**,
   **conditional formatting**, and a **live runtime SQL splice** in one go.
3. Review the views (section 3a) — start with the HTML mockup.
4. **Read the verdict banner** (section 4) before downloading.
5. Download the `.rdl` and deploy (section 8).

> First time in the app? Click **ⓘ How it works** (top right) →
> **Start the guided tour**. It converts a sample and walks every view
> with an explanation of what each one is for.

## 3a. What each view is for

| View | What it shows | When you use it |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Preview** | The generated RDL rendered by Microsoft's own ReportViewer engine — real pages, real pagination (an instant HTML mockup stands in while the engine works). Frontend/Backend toggle switches between the rendered look and the label/binding skeleton; a Sample-rows control re-renders at any sample size. | The "does it look right?" check — against the real engine, not an approximation. Conditional formatting, seals, letters and in-report action buttons all render here. |
| **RDL XML** | The generated SSRS definition — the file you deploy. Very large documents preview the first chunk; downloads always carry the complete file. | Transparency, diffing, and copy-pasting fragments. |
| **Side-by-side** | Oracle source XML next to the generated RDL. | Auditing: "where did this column / query / label end up?" |
| **Live data** | Runs the report's real queries against your database (connection string in the sidebar); parameter inputs + row grid. | Prove the SQL returns the right rows *before* the report server is involved. |
| **Validation** | The full pre-flight audit behind the verdict banner; every finding says what happens at run time and what to do. | Triage before deployment. BLOCKER = won't work, RED = wrong output, AMBER = check, READY = deploy. |
| **Deployment** | The go-live checklist: shared data source, upload steps, why you skip Refresh Fields, download buttons. | Every deployment, until it's muscle memory. |
| **Extras** | Fidelity scorecard (nothing silently lost), conversion audit trail. | Deep dives. |
| **Bursting** | One rendered file per key (Oracle `distribute=YES`): the Burst Pack — filtered RDL + key-list RDL + `Run-Burst.ps1` driver — replaces Oracle distribution on any SSRS edition. | Letter/invoice/permit runs that produce one file per record. |
| **Sub-reports** | Auto-detected child reports (envelopes, detail pages) with a dropzone to convert each through the same pipeline. | Reports whose rows drill through to another report. |

Advanced views are hidden behind **Show advanced views** until you need
them — the three tabs shown by default (Mockup, RDL, Bursting) cover the
common flow.

## 4. The verdict banner

Every conversion is audited by a preflight validator plus a static layout
auditor. The banner is the worst finding:

| Verdict | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **READY** | No blocking or data-correctness findings. | Deploy. |
| **AMBER** | The report opens, publishes and runs, but something on the page is not faithful — a layout clip risk, an auxiliary dataset that never renders, a linked detail intentionally unused, **or declared text that will not print at all**. Not all of these are cosmetic: read them. | Deploy; review every note. |
| **RED** | A data-correctness risk that will not error at run time — the worst kind. | Fix or consciously accept before go-live. |
| **BLOCKER** | The report will fail to publish or is not a convertible source at all. | Must fix. |

Rules you are most likely to see:

- `source.unsupported_kind` (**BLOCKER**) — the file isn't an Oracle
  Reports definition (e.g. a Reports Server bursting/distribution spec, a
  JasperReports design, an Oracle Forms module). The message says what it
  actually is.
- `rdl.hollow_body` (**BLOCKER**) — the body references zero dataset
  fields while real fields exist; the output would render blank pages.
- `rdl.placeholder_dataset.*` (**RED**) — column extraction failed for a
  query; anything bound to it renders empty.
- `sql.lexical_identifier.*` / `sql.lexical_tablesource.*` (**BLOCKER**)
  — a runtime lexical (`&P_X`) formed part of a table/column name; the
  emitted SQL cannot run until you substitute the real identifier.
- `sql.lexical_where_dropped.*` (**RED**) — the source filtered rows
  through a runtime lexical WHERE fragment; the converted query runs
  **unfiltered** until you reimplement the filter. Nothing errors — the
  report just returns every row. Take this seriously.
- `sql.lexical_nevermatch.*` (**RED**) — a lexical inside an
  IN/comparison operand was NULL-stubbed; that predicate can never match,
  so the dataset returns **zero rows** until reimplemented.
- `sql.lexical_operand_null.*` (**AMBER**) — a lexical filled an
  expression operand; the computed column degrades to NULL.
- `rdl.linked_detail_not_rendered.*` (**AMBER**) — a linked child query
  is never bound to any region. Legitimate for auxiliary queries (LOV /
  formula feeders); a data loss if that detail was supposed to print.
- `rdl.unresolved_token_blank` (**AMBER**) — a declared boilerplate token
  (`&P_SUBTITLE`, `&CP_...`) that no parameter, dataset column or
  translatable formula can satisfy. It is emitted as an empty value, so
  the token never prints as raw ink — but the text it stood for **does
  not print either**, and a blanked caption looks identical in the PDF to
  a caption that was never declared. This one is **not cosmetic**: the
  commonest sources are a parameter a PL/SQL trigger computes at run time
  (a criteria subtitle, a "run by" identity), a placeholder column a
  format trigger fills (a letter paragraph, a licence holder's name) and
  a field belonging to a sibling dataset (a letter's signature block).
  The message names the token, the report item and what to supply. Check
  it against the original report's output before go-live; it lifts the
  banner off READY on purpose.

---

## 5. The fidelity card

Each conversion carries a fidelity report (`fidelity_report` in the API
payload, the *Extras* card in the UI):

- **score** — `1.0` means no silent loss of parameters, dataset columns,
  or layout-placed data columns. Anything lower names exactly what
  dropped.
- **categories.layout_fields.display_coverage** — the stricter secondary
  axis: the share of layout columns actually referenced by a display
  expression. A report can declare every column (score 1.0) yet display
  few of them — this number exposes that.
- **needs_attention** — a plain-English list: formulas wired as stubs,
  totals not rendered, orphaned datasets, non-SQL data sources, charts
  auto-built.

---

## 6. Labels, overrides, and things a source can't tell us

Some display text simply isn't in the export (a bundle built from bare
SQL has no title; operator-supplied captions live in people's heads).
The **label-override facility** closes that gap generically:

- Every conversion returns `overridable_labels` — an inventory of each
  literal label in the output (name, current text, region).
- POST `label_overrides` (JSON object) with your replacements, keyed by
  the inventory name — or the shorthand key `"title"` for the report
  title. Data expressions can never be overridden, only labels.

```bash
curl -F "file=@REPORT.xml" \
     -F 'label_overrides={"title":"Quarterly Contacts List"}' \
     http://localhost:5000/api/convert
```

---

## 7. Data source binding

- **Shared data source (recommended):** set the shared data source path
  in the sidebar once; every artifact produced in the session (downloads,
  batch output, sub-reports) binds to it.
- **Embedded:** supply a connection string per request.
- Undeclared query binds default to `Nothing` so SSRS **never prompts
  end users** — at upload or at run — a deliberate, load-bearing design.
  Optional prompts stay optional: `col = :P` predicates are NULL-guarded,
  so an empty prompt means *all rows*, not zero.
- **Do not click Refresh Fields.** The field list is emitted complete, so
  there is nothing to refresh. Manually executing a parameterized
  dataset's query in the designer (Refresh Fields / Query Designer ▸ Run)
  makes **Report Builder itself** ask for design-time parameter values —
  that dialog is Report Builder behavior for *any* parameterized query,
  not a defect in the RDL. If you land in it, OK with nulls is safe: the
  SELECT list is static, so the field metadata is identical.

---

## 8. Deploy to a Report Server

1. Upload the `.rdl` via the Report Server web portal (or
   `rs.exe` / PowerShell `Publish-RsRestItemContent`).
2. Point the report at your data source (shared reference recommended).
3. **Run.** Skip Refresh Fields — the field list is emitted complete and
   already matches the SQL aliases exactly, so there is nothing to
   refresh. (Refresh Fields executes the query at design time, and for a
   parameterized query Report Builder will ask for design-time values —
   its own dialog, not an RDL defect. OK-with-nulls is safe if you land
   there.)
4. Run with real parameters and compare against a known-good output of
   the original report.
5. For DATE parameters, values pass as `yyyy-MM-dd` strings and are
   `TO_DATE`-wrapped in the SQL — enter dates in that format when testing
   outside the portal's date picker.

---

## 9. Batch conversion & assessment

```bash
python -m backend.converter.batch <folder-of-xml> --out <outdir>
```

Produces every RDL plus a **Migration Assessment** (per-report verdicts,
fidelity scores, effort tiers). The community tier processes batches of
10; set `O2S_LICENSE` for larger tiers. The same runs via `/api/batch`.

---

## 10. Sub-reports & bursting

- **Sub-reports:** drop a child artifact onto a detected drill-through
  link; the child is built through the full pipeline (RDL + mockup) with
  the parent's forwarded parameters declared and hidden, and the drilled
  key NULL-guard-filtered so a standalone run still returns rows.
- **Bursting:** per-key distribution instructions are detected and the
  Bursting pane builds a **Burst Pack** zip: the report with a hidden
  `P_O2S_BURST_KEY` filter parameter, a `<Report>_BurstList.rdl` key-list
  report, `Run-Burst.ps1` (Windows PowerShell 5.1 built-ins only, renders
  one file per key through SSRS URL access), `burst.config.json`, a README
  and the service-account checklist. Upload BOTH `.rdl` files to one folder,
  fill the config, run `Run-Burst.ps1 -DryRun` from your own PC, then
  `-TestLimit 2`, then schedule it under a service account. Pure
  distribution specs (a `<destinations>` file) are classified honestly
  rather than converted.

---

## 11. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Upload rejected by Report Server | Check the verdict banner first — BLOCKER findings name the exact publish error class. |
| Report prompts for a parameter | Should never happen with this converter's output; re-download and confirm you didn't hand-edit defaults. |
| Every row / no rows returned | See the `sql.lexical_*` RED findings — a runtime lexical filter needs reimplementing (dynamic WHERE or parameter-guarded predicates). |
| Blank columns | The fidelity card's `needs_attention` names unbound columns and stubbed formulas; supply the SQL/UDF where noted. |
| Dates print like `6/8/2026 12:00:00 AM` | Fixed automatically for masked fields; if you see it, the source field carried no `formatMask` — set a Format in Report Builder. |
| A conditionally-printed frame always prints | Its PL/SQL format trigger was beyond the supported translation subset — the preflight notes list untranslated triggers. |
| Wide report spills across pages | Intentional: reports genuinely wider than the page paginate horizontally at legible column widths instead of crushing to fit. |
