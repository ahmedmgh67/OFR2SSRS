"""THE STRICT BLANK MEASURE — the rule every render rail gates on.

These are engine-free: they feed the measure page TEXT and an RDL, so they run
on any machine and pin the rule itself rather than a render.

The rule they pin exists because a judge broke the old one. It stripped two
hardcoded English literals ('page ', 'report run on') and called a page blank
when under 8 characters were left. A mutation that kept the report's PageHeader
intact printed a genuinely empty data sheet, the repeated title counted as
residual content, and every rail that imports this measure stayed GREEN. Page
furniture is now derived from the ARTIFACT — the RDL's own page bands and the
lines the document repeats — so the rule works in whatever language the report
is written in, which the corpus (Spanish, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, CJK sources)
requires and an English wordlist can never deliver.

A second judge then proved the REPLACEMENT blind, in a way these tests could
not see: they are engine-free, so their page text is hand-written and always
decodable. On a real render the PDF writer embeds non-Latin subsets with no
ToUnicode CMap, nothing extracts, and the same artifact that reported a blank
sheet in English reported none in Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic or CJK. The
ENGINE-BASED section at the foot of this file measures that directly and
mutation-proves the ink rule that closes it.

Two more judges then measured what was LEFT of the number — the 8-character
floor itself, the last rule the artifact did not supply. It called a sheet
printing a short real value blank, and it gave one visual state opposite
verdicts in different scripts, because a character is not one unit across
scripts. Section (E) at the foot of this file removes it: one mark of content
ink IS content, measured on the page. Its arms run in NINE scripts — ascii,
accented Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, CJK, Hangul, Thai — because
a rule that behaves differently for one of them is the defect.

Every test below is an A/B: the same pages measured with and without the thing
under test, so a test that would pass for the wrong reason fails instead.

# (F) INK THAT HIDES A BLANK SHEET — a band seal, a white raster, white text
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A judge hid an empty sheet three ways, all reachable in production (154 of
# 308 shipping sources emit an <Image> inside a page band; 5 declare
# PrintOnFirstPage=false; 3 pair both):
#
#   (a) a seal declared in <PageHeader> with PrintOnFirstPage=false prints on
#       sheets 2..N, so the raster furniture rule — "present on EVERY page" —
#       never classified it as furniture and its ink made an empty sheet read
#       as inked;
#   (b) a white-only raster, and
#   (c) white-coloured text, each of which made a sheet PIXEL-IDENTICAL to a
#       known blank one read as content.
#
# The arms below are the same artifact with one variable changed, and each
# hider is paired with the honest construction it is indistinguishable from
# under the broken rule: a band seal on a sheet that DOES carry content, a
# raster a reader can see, and white text on a dark fill — which is not a
# hider at all but a table header, and must stay content.
#
# The script parametrisation is not decoration. Rule (c) reaches the text a
# sheet is measured on, and the campaign's standing defect is a rule that
# works in English and fails in Greek — so every arm that touches text is
# measured in all nine scripts, and the invariance is asserted directly.

# pass read perfectly and found nothing special on. Rules (D), (E) and (F) all
# read their geometry out of that list, so ONE broken PyMuPDF, one unreadable
# page or one renamed API would delete the entire non-Latin fix from every
# rail at once — and the rails would stay GREEN, because a deleted rule (D)
# produces exactly the wrongly-green verdict it was built to stop.
#
# The tests below hold both halves of the new contract:
#   * every failure of the ink PASS raises ``InkMeasurementError``, chained to
#     what actually went wrong, and it reaches the rail through
#     ``page_image_marks`` and ``measure_pdf`` instead of stopping at them;
#   * the ONE remaining empty-list leg is the ABSENCE of PyMuPDF, and it is
#     distinguishable — ``ink_available()`` answers False there and True
#     everywhere else, which is the distinction that did not exist before.
#
# The engine arm is parametrized over all nine scripts on purpose. The FAILURE
# is script-independent (an exception is an exception) and that is the claim
# under test: the old silent answer was NOT script-independent — it left ascii
# and accented Latin correct while turning every non-Latin sheet green.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (L-7) THE ADDITIVITY GATE HAS TO BE ABLE TO GO RED
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``additivity_exceptions`` names every page the two rules disagree on by
# re-reading ``_page_content_legs`` — the SAME helper ``classify`` reached its
# verdict with. Every page in the divergence set is therefore a page
# ``classify`` called ``content``, so one of the three legs is truthy, so a
# name was always found: ``unjustified`` — the branch the rails gate on — was
# unreachable from any render. A judge proved it. A gate that cannot fail is
# not a gate, and the two callers that read this field (the hostile-shape
# rail's L-7 leg and ``measure_pdf``'s ``additivity`` map) were gating on a
# comparison that could only ever agree with itself.
#
# The repair is that the one name claiming MORE than its own leg has to prove
# the claim. A raster is a raster and undecodable ink is undecodable, but
# ``content_under_legacy_floor`` says the divergence IS the historical
# eight-character floor, and that is a measurement: ``_content_residual``
# runs the legacy literal test first and then deletes more, so on the same
# page text the new residual can never be LONGER than the legacy one. A
# residual that clears the floor on a page the legacy rule called blank is
# arithmetically impossible unless a rule changed — which is what an
# additivity regression is — and it is now named ``unjustified``.
#
# MEASURED, on every render this repo has produced that still has its RDL
# beside it — 3,815 renders, 16,326 sheets:
#
#   honest        53 divergence pages, 0 reddened. The longest residual any
#                 page carried under the floor's name is SEVEN characters, so
#                 the floor is asserted with a character to spare and the
#                 repair costs the corpus nothing.
#   regressed     with furniture stripping removed — a real additivity
#                 regression, on the same renders — the OLD comparison named
#                 all 39 affected pages ``content_under_legacy_floor`` and
#                 every render stayed GREEN. The repaired one names 27 of
#                 them ``unjustified`` and reddens 23 renders, while the 12
#                 honest short-value pages keep their name unchanged.
#
# These are the acceptance tests, run as a MATRIX because both standing laws
# apply to a gate as much as to a measure:
#
#   L-A  one visual state, nine scripts, one verdict. Rule (C) is about the
#        HISTORICAL rule's own English fallback wording, so that wording is
#        what the trailing sheet carries and is held fixed; the report's body
#        varies over all nine scripts.
#   L-B  the same trailing sheet at 0, 1, 3 and 25 rows. The sheet is one the
#        report spills onto AFTER its data, so a rule that went inert at one
#        row count would show up here as a green arm.

# The engine's own run stamp — one of the two literals the historical rule
# hardcoded, which is why rule (C) exists and what a mutation of it removes.
