"""Render the SYNTHETIC fixtures through Microsoft's actual report engine.

This is the strongest regression net in the suite: a generated RDL is fed
to the same processing/rendering code SSRS runs, with synthetic rows, and
the produced PDF is opened and measured. Skips cleanly when the
ReportViewer DLLs haven't been fetched (tools/renderlab/README.md) so the
public repo's CI never breaks — on dev machines with the DLLs it proves:

  * the RDL renders AT ALL (the ultimate "upload will work" check),
  * no blank-page cadence,
  * no engine overlap warnings (the content-clipping bug class).
