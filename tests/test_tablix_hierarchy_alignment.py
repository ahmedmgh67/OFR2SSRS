"""Tablix structural invariant: the number of TablixRows must equal the
number of INNERMOST TablixMembers in the TablixRowHierarchy. Same rule
for TablixColumns vs TablixColumnHierarchy.

SSRS rejects RDL upload with:

    "The tablix '<Name>' has an incorrect number of TablixRows. The
    number of TablixRows must equal the number of innermost
    TablixMembers (TablixMembers with no submembers) in the
    TablixRowHierarchy."

(and the analogous error for columns.)

This is the exact upload-blocker the user hit when SAMPLE_DRILLTHROUGH was
converted: the generator emitted a hierarchy with 3 innermost members
(band + card + spurious detail placeholder) but only 2 TablixRows
(band + card). The test below walks every emitted Tablix and asserts
the counts line up, name-agnostic, parameterized over every fixture +
the synthetic conftest fixture.
