"""STRICT BLANK-PAGE MEASURE — one implementation, shared by every rail.

A rendered sheet is BLANK when a reader would see no report CONTENT on it.
Page furniture (the running title, the page number, the run stamp) is ink, but
it is not content: a sheet carrying only furniture is a blank sheet.

    from blank_measure import measure_pdf
    m = measure_pdf(pdf_path, rdl_xml=rdl)      # {"pages", "blank", ...}

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS — a judge measured the previous rule and proved it
blind. Every caller carried its own copy of::

    residual = "".join(ln for ln in text.splitlines()
                       if not ln.lower().startswith(("page ", "report run on")))
    blank = len(residual.strip()) < 8

Two hardcoded ENGLISH literals were the entire definition of page furniture,
so a genuinely empty data sheet was reported as INKED whenever the page
furniture said anything else — a running title in a PageHeader, a Spanish
page-number line, a Greek footer. The mutation that exposed it kept the
PageHeader intact and the rails stayed green on a blank page.

WHAT REPLACES IT — the furniture is derived from the ARTIFACT, never from a
list of English words:

  (A) DECLARED page bands.  Every text fragment the RDL emits inside its
      <PageHeader>/<PageFooter> is furniture BY DECLARATION: static <Value>
      text verbatim, and for an =expression its string LITERALS (so
      ="Page " & Globals!PageNumber & " of " & Globals!TotalPages yields the
      fragments "Page " and " of " — and the Greek, Spanish or Arabic wording
      of the same expression yields that wording, because it is read out of
      the report instead of assumed). WHERE THE INK'S PLACE IS KNOWN the
      declaration is read the way (D) reads it — by the strip it RESERVES
      (``band_resident_keys``), never by its wording turning up somewhere on
      the sheet: a body line that repeats the running title is content where
      the report printed it, in every script. The wording alone decides only
      a line no geometry located (no PyMuPDF, or an extracted line the PDF's
      own line boxes split differently): a line the deletion empties WAS that
      furniture, and a line it leaves a REMAINDER on is settled by a length
      comparison, because there that is the only evidence there is — see (E)
      and ``_content_residual``. It was not always so: the wording was
      deleted from ANY line, located or not, and one artifact rendered in
      nine scripts had its title-repeating body sheet read blank in the two
      scripts whose glyphs decode and content in the seven whose glyphs do
      not — the same declaration judged by two standards.
  (B) REPEATED lines.  A line that appears on EVERY page of the document is
      furniture whatever language it is in — this catches page furniture
      emitted from the body flow, and any constant stamp, with no wordlist at
      all. Strictly every page, and literal, not digit-normalised: both
      relaxations were measured to eat real content (see
      ``repeated_line_chrome``).
  (C) The two legacy literals stay ON as a fallback, so a caller that passes
      no RDL keeps exactly the coverage it had before. The rule is ADDITIVE:
      nothing the old measure called blank stops being blank — and that claim
      is EXECUTABLE, not prose. ``legacy_blanks`` re-runs the historical rule
      on the same render and ``additivity_exceptions`` maps every page the two
      disagree on to the NAMED later rule that licenses the difference —
      (E) short content under the old character floor, (D) undecodable ink,
      (D)/(F) a raster. Anything else is ``unjustified`` and a caller gates on
      it. The claim was prose once and it was FALSE: a whole-render condition
      inside ``strict_blanks`` made three furniture-only sheets that the old
      rule flagged come back clean. The COMPARISON was prose once too: it
      labelled each divergent page after whichever leg was truthy, which is
      always one of them, so ``unjustified`` could not be reached and the gate
      could not fail. Each name now carries its own claim — see
      ``additivity_exceptions``.
  (D) INK, not characters. (A)/(B)/(C) all compare TEXT, and a second judge
      proved that measuring text is itself corpus-shaped: the ReportViewer PDF
      writer embeds non-Latin subsets as composite fonts with no ToUnicode
      CMap, so not one glyph of a Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic or CJK page band
      decodes and the same artifact that reported blank=[2] in English
      reported blank=[] in every one of them. Undecodable ink is therefore
      taken out of the text rules and judged by WHERE IT LIES — inside a page
      band the RDL declares, or on a line the document repeats on every sheet,
      it is furniture; anywhere else it is content. See section (D) below for
      the measurement and the mechanism.
  (E) ONE MARK IS CONTENT — no character count decides anything. The last
      number in this module was an 8-CHARACTER floor on the residual, and it
      was the only rule left that the artifact did not supply. It called a
      sheet printing '$1,200', '41205', 'N/A' or '0.00' blank and the same
      sheet printing 'APPROVED' inked, and — since a character is not one
      unit across scripts — it gave the SAME visual state opposite verdicts in
      ascii/accented Latin and in Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, CJK, Hangul
      and Thai. It is gone: a page carries content when it paints one mark of
      ink that (A)-(D) did not claim, and a page is ``empty`` when it paints
      no ink at all — both measured on the page, not counted in characters.
      Removing it needed its other half: the geometry of (D) applied to
      DECODABLE lines too (``band_resident_keys``), so a page band is
      furniture by the same rule in every script. See section (E) below.
  (F) INK A READER CANNOT SEE IS NOT INK, and RASTER furniture follows the
      DECLARATION like everything else. A judge hid a blank sheet three ways
      and all three were reachable in production: a seal declared in a page
      band that does not print on the first sheet (so the "present on every
      page" raster rule could never classify it as furniture), a white-only
      raster, and white-coloured text. The first is fixed by reading the
      declaration — a mark inside the strip the RDL reserves for a band is
      furniture on the pages it prints (``band_resident_images``), which is
      the rule text has been judged by since (D). The other two are fixed by
      measuring VISIBLE CONTRAST against the page's own ground instead of
      counting presence. See section (F) below.
  (G) TECHNICALLY NOT BLANK IS NOT THE SAME AS FIT TO MAIL. Everything above
      answers "is there ink?", so a sheet carrying one stray word passes —
      and six sheets of a production letter went out carrying one word while
      every rail reported clean. ``sparse_sheets`` is the missing measure: a
      sheet an order of magnitude STARVED beside the fullest sheet of its own
      document, which REPRINTS the report's own wording off a fuller sheet
      and received an order of magnitude fewer DATA CELLS than the sheet that
      received most. Each of the three is measured against what this same
      document's sheets carry, because the alternatives were measured and are
      not the report's: a starvation RATIO puts the same closing block at
      4.2x in Greek and 16.5x in Arabic, "no other sheet carries this mark"
      is a fact about the row count (at one record nothing repeats), and a
      data cell's INK in a layout render is as wide as the staticizer felt
      like writing. It is reported alongside ``blank``, never inside it — a
      sparse sheet is a ``content`` sheet and the two gates are disjoint. See
      section (G) below.

CLASSES — "no content ink" is not one thing, and the difference decides
whether a sheet is a defect:

  content        the page carries report content — text, or a raster image
                 (a chart, a map, a scanned form) that neither the page bands
                 declare nor every sheet repeats. TEXT IS NOT THE ONLY INK;
                 measuring only text calls a chart sheet blank.
  chrome_only    the page carries ink, but only page furniture. A reader sees
                 an empty sheet. THIS is the class the old rule could not see.
  empty          the page carries no ink a reader can see. A white-only
                 raster and a run of white glyphs on white paper are both
                 this: present in the file, absent from the sheet.

``blank`` = every ``empty`` page and every ``chrome_only`` page. PER PAGE, and
per page only: what decides a sheet is that sheet's ink and the artifact's
declarations, never anything about the OTHER sheets of the render.

It was not always per page. ``chrome_only`` used to count only WHENEVER the
document had content somewhere, so that an all-furniture render — the honest
zero-row outcome of a report whose filter matched nothing — would not read as
a document of manufactured blank sheets. That intent is right and it is kept.
Expressing it as a condition on the verdict was not: "the document has content
somewhere" is a fact about the RENDER's row count, and two judges measured
what building it into a per-page rule does. At zero rows the leg CANNOT FIRE —
three furniture-only sheets came back ``blank=[]`` where the rule this module
replaced reported ``[1, 2, 3]``, refuting the very ADDITIVITY contract stated
in (C) below — and the same static sheet, byte-identical, was blank at 1/3/25
rows and not blank at 0. The intent now lives in ``printed_no_content``, a
DOCUMENT-level measurement reported beside ``blank``, so a caller that wants
to treat an empty report differently has to say so where it can be read, and
a caller that says nothing measures every sheet.

A FAILED MEASUREMENT IS NOT A VERDICT. Rules (D), (E) and (F) all read their
geometry from one pass over the PDF, and that pass used to answer every fault
with the same empty list it gives for a sheet it read perfectly — so a broken
reader deleted the whole non-Latin rule from every rail and every rail stayed
GREEN. Any failure of the pass now raises ``InkMeasurementError`` and reaches
the caller; the ONE thing that still answers quietly is the ABSENCE of PyMuPDF,
which ``ink_available()`` reports so absence and fault can be told apart.

LAYOUT-MODE CAVEAT (measured, not theoretical): when the expression host is
unavailable the harness renders STATICIZED RDLs, where every =expression has
been replaced by invented placeholder text. On such a render an
expression-only sheet ALWAYS carries ink, so a page that would come back blank
with real data CANNOT be detected there — no measure of that PDF can. What is
expressible is the page's ink PROVENANCE: ``placeholder_only`` marks a page
whose entire content is text the staticizer invented, i.e. a page that is
blank-with-real-data whenever those expressions evaluate empty. It is reported,
never gated on: it is a suspicion, not a defect.

The same caveat constrains rule (B) in this mode, and that constraint is not
optional: in a layout render every expression-bound cell prints the SAME
invented token on every sheet, so "this line repeats on every page" stops
being evidence of furniture. Repeated lines that overlap invented text are
therefore exempt from (B) while (A) — which reads the declaration, not the
render — keeps working unchanged. Measured: without the exemption a permits
table, a leave-status matrix and a wide sales matrix reported 25 of 26, 6 of
14 and 24 of 39 sheets blank; with it they report none, and their sheets show
up in ``placeholder_only`` instead, where they belong until the expression
host can answer the question.

    Two deliberate strictnesses, both measured on the corpus rather than
    reasoned:

    * Compared LITERALLY, never digit-normalised. A per-record letter's sheets
      differ only in their values; normalising digits away collapses two
      record sheets into one repeated line and calls every record sheet blank.
      Varying furniture (a page counter) is caught by its DECLARED fragments
      instead — which is also the only language-agnostic way to catch it.
    * Present on EVERY page, not "all but one". Relaxing by a single page was
      measured to eat whole documents: in a LAYOUT-mode render a per-record
      permit's 25 record sheets are byte-identical placeholder text, so at
      "all but one" every record sheet became furniture and 25 of 26 pages
      read as blank. On the strict rule those sheets miss the cover page and
      stay content, while real furniture — which the cover carries too —
      still goes. A document whose pages are ALL identical strips to nothing
      everywhere, and ``strict_blanks`` refuses to call that a blank-sheet
      defect.

    ``invented`` exempts the staticizer's placeholder strings (layout mode
    only). The premise of this rule — repeated text is furniture — holds only
    while DATA varies between pages, and in a layout render it does not: every
    expression-bound cell prints the same invented token on every sheet.
    Measured: a permits table's data rows staticize to identical text, so
    without this exemption its continuation sheets stripped to nothing and
    read as blank. A line made only of invented tokens is not provably
    furniture in this mode; it is the ``placeholder_only`` suspicion instead.

    ``declared`` (the report's own static wording, from
    ``declared_static_texts``) settles the WRAPPED half of that exemption —
    see ``_overlaps_invented``.

    ``content`` is wording the artifact declares as CONTENT and prints on
    every sheet BY DESIGN, which is the one place this rule's premise —
    repeated text is furniture — inverts. A data region's ``NoRowsMessage``
    is exactly that: on a zero-row render it lands on every sheet the region
    reaches, and it is the only thing the reader is there to see. Measured on
    four wild reports whose zero-row render printed a correct notice on every
    sheet: without this exemption every one of those sheets stripped to
    nothing and classified ``chrome_only``, so the measure reported a

# (D) ink the page PAINTS — the verdict when the glyphs do not decode
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE HOLE THIS CLOSES — a judge rendered ONE minimal artifact in six
# languages, varying nothing but the wording of its page bands, and measured:
#
#     ascii / spanish / spanish-accents -> blank=[2]   (correctly RED)
#     greek / cyrillic / arabic         -> blank=[]    (GREEN, empty sheet)
#     cjk                               -> whichever the GLYPH COUNT decided
#
# The CJK row is the sharpest evidence of all: its glyphs extract as NUL
# bytes, so a 7-glyph running title left 7 residual characters, fell under the
# 8-character floor, and the sheet read blank BY ACCIDENT — while the same
# artifact with a 16-glyph title cleared the floor and the same empty sheet
# read as inked. A gate whose verdict turns on how many characters a word
# happens to have is not measuring anything.
#
# Mechanism, measured in the PDFs: for text outside WinAnsi the ReportViewer
# writer embeds a subset as a COMPOSITE font (/Type0, /Identity-H) and emits
# NO ToUnicode CMap, so the byte stream carries GLYPH IDS, not characters.
# Extraction can only guess: pypdf hands back mojibake, MuPDF is honest and
# hands back U+FFFD. Either way not one fragment of the report's declared
# wording survives, so rules (A)/(B)/(C) — all of which compare TEXT — have
# nothing to match, the furniture counts as residual content, and the page's
# emptiness verdict flips. Isolation was proven both ways: deleting the
# declared-chrome derivation flips ascii [2]->[] (it is load-bearing) and
# leaves greek []->[] (it never contributed anything).
#
# THE FIX — a page's emptiness must not depend on decoding characters at all.
# Ink that does not decode is still INK, and its GEOMETRY is exact: MuPDF
# reports a bbox and a glyph id for every glyph it cannot map. So undecodable
# text is taken out of the text rules entirely and judged where it LIES:
#
#   * inside a page band the RDL DECLARES (the strip the engine reserves for
#     the PageHeader / PageFooter, computed from the artifact's own margins
#     and band heights) -> page furniture, whatever it says;
#   * on a LINE the document repeats on EVERY page -> page furniture too,
#     same rule and same strictness as (B), which is how a band painted from
#     the body flow is caught;
#   * anywhere else -> report CONTENT.
#
# The hole needed BOTH halves. Dropping the undecodable text alone would call
# a Greek report's DATA pages blank; the geometric leg alone cannot stop the
# mojibake counting as residual content.
#
# Pages whose every glyph decodes are untouched by all of this — the text path
# stays the fast pre-filter wherever extraction demonstrably works, which is
# the whole shipping corpus (Type1/WinAnsi on 13 of 14 truth reports, and the
# 14th only for four body spans). A/B over every PDF the campaign has on disk:
# 188 of 192 verdicts identical, and the 4 that moved are the judge's own
# non-Latin artifacts, each moving from wrongly-GREEN to RED.
#
# Vector strokes stay out of this, exactly as they stay out of
# ``page_image_marks``: every ruled table and every box border draws them, so
# counting them would make every page inked and the measure would stop
# measuring anything. Glyph ink and raster images are the ink that carries
# meaning.

# What MuPDF reports for a glyph it cannot map to a character. NUL is the same
# statement from a subset whose CIDs begin at zero.
UNDECODED = (0, 0xFFFD)

# what an undecoded subset reports for ink that is certainly there, which is
# the whole reason section (D) exists.

# (F) INK A READER CANNOT SEE IS NOT INK — visible contrast against the ground
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE HOLE THIS CLOSES — a judge hid a blank sheet three ways, all of them
# reachable in production (154 of 308 shipping sources emit an <Image> inside
# a page band; 5 declare PrintOnFirstPage=false; 3 pair both):
#
#   (a) a seal declared in <PageHeader> with PrintOnFirstPage=false prints on
#       sheets 2..N. The raster furniture rule was the REPETITION heuristic —
#       "present on every page" — so the seal was never furniture, its ink
#       counted as content, and an otherwise empty sheet read as inked. Fixed
#       by DECLARATION: a mark inside the strip the RDL reserves for a page
#       band is furniture on the pages it prints (``band_resident_images``),
#       which is the rule text has been judged by since section (D).
#   (b) a white-only raster, and (c) white-coloured text: ink that is present
#       but cannot be SEEN. Both made a sheet pixel-identical to a known blank
#       one read as content.
#
# THE RULE — a mark counts when the sheet paints, inside its box, something a
# reader can tell from the PAGE GROUND. Both halves are measured, neither is
# assumed:
#
#   * the ground is the most-used colour of the rendered sheet, so a report
#     that paints its own background is judged against THAT and not against an
#     assumed white — and white text on a dark fill stays content, because its
#     glyphs differ from the ground the fill established;
#   * the mark is rasterised where it lies and compared to that ground, so
#     opacity, blend, clipping and overpainting are all accounted for by the
#     renderer instead of re-implemented here. A span's own declared colour is
#     only the PREFILTER that decides whether the question is worth asking.
#
# CONTRAST is a ROUNDING floor, not a visibility taste, and what it absorbs
# was measured rather than imagined: a colour as DECLARED and the same colour
# as RENDERED differ by one unit per channel (the engine's own #182430 fill
# comes back as (23,35,47)), so a zero tolerance stops recognising a report's
# background as its own background. Everything real sits decades away from it:
# every raster the shipping reports paint deviates from the ground by 248-255
# per channel, and a solid white field survives JPEG at quality 95/75/50 with
# a deviation of 0. Over the 36 artifacts of this campaign's hidden-ink suite
# every value from 1 to 64 gives IDENTICAL verdicts; only 0 changes one, and
# it changes it by failing to see the render's rounding.

    """The ink pass was ATTEMPTED and FAILED.

    THE HOLE THIS CLOSES — ``page_ink`` used to answer every failure with an
    empty list, which is the same answer it gives for a sheet that paints no
    ink the text rules must not read. "There is no undecodable ink here" and
    "the measurement crashed" were therefore indistinguishable, and rules (D),
    (E) and (F) all read their geometry out of that list: a broken PyMuPDF, an
    unreadable page, one API rename would delete the whole non-Latin fix from
    every rail at once and every rail would stay GREEN, because the verdict a
    deleted rule (D) produces on a non-Latin sheet is exactly the wrongly-green
    one it was built to stop (measured: blank=[2] becomes blank=[] on Greek,
    Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, CJK, Hangul and Thai renders of one artifact —
    see ``test_mutation_removing_the_ink_rule_reopens_the_non_latin_hole``).

    So a failure is now LOUD: it propagates through ``page_image_marks`` and
    ``measure_pdf`` to the rail, which fails instead of passing. The single
    exception is the ABSENCE of PyMuPDF, which is not a failure but a stated
    environmental precondition — a caller can ask ``ink_available()`` and get
    a different answer than it gets for a crash, which is the distinction that

    ``undecodable``/``decodable_text`` serve section (D). ``lines`` and
    ``glyphs`` serve section (E): every line the page paints WITH its box, so
    a line can be judged by where it lies, and the count of visible glyphs on
    the sheet, so "this page paints nothing at all" is a measurement instead
    of a character count. Whitespace glyphs are not counted — a sheet of
    spaces paints nothing a reader can see, and counting them would flip an
    all-blank document into an all-``chrome_only`` one, which
    ``strict_blanks`` reports as no defect at all.

    The unit is a LINE, not a span, so that the repeat rule below is the exact
    twin of ``repeated_line_chrome`` and not a stricter cousin of it. A line's
    signature interleaves the text that DOES decode with the GLYPH IDS of the
    text that does not, in painting order — so "<caption> <value>" is one
    signature that changes when the value changes, exactly as the text rule's
    line key does. Keying on the caption alone would make a per-page label
    furniture and could call a sheet carrying a real value blank, which is the
    language-dependent divergence this whole rule exists to remove.

    ``decodable_text`` is the page's text with the ink the text rules must
    not read removed — what does not decode (section (D)) and what is not
    visible (section (F)). ``None`` when neither happened on the page, in
    which case the extracted text is used unchanged.

    ``images`` are the sheet's raster marks with their boxes, and ``ground``
    the colour of the paper under them; ``invisible`` are the text runs the
    sheet paints in the ground's own colour — ink no reader can see. All
    three serve section (F).

    THE EMPTY LIST MEANS ONE THING ONLY: PyMuPDF is not installed here, which
    is the ONE condition a caller can check for itself (``ink_available``) and
    the one this module has always documented as optional. Every OTHER failure
    RAISES ``InkMeasurementError`` — see the note above that class. A measure

# (E) how MUCH content ink a page must paint — one mark, measured in ink
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE HOLE THIS CLOSES — the last rule in this module that was not derived
# from the artifact was a number: a page carried content when 8 or more
# CHARACTERS survived the furniture strip. Two judges hit it from opposite
# sides and both were reproduced here on ENGINE renders of one artifact whose
# only variable is the wording of its page bands:
#
#   * a sheet printing a real value reads BLANK because the value is short.
#     Measured, same artifact, second sheet carrying one value:
#         '$1,200' -> blank=[2]   '41205' -> blank=[2]
#         'N/A'    -> blank=[2]   '0.00'  -> blank=[2]
#         'Total 42' -> blank=[]  'APPROVED' -> blank=[]
#     The verdict tracked the LENGTH of the value, nothing else.
#   * and the same visual state got different verdicts per SCRIPT: a short
#     native word on that sheet reported blank=[2] in ascii and accented
#     Latin, and blank=[] in Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, CJK, Hangul and
#     Thai — because those glyphs do not decode, so section (D) judged them as
#     ink (correctly, with no floor) while the Latin ones were judged as
#     characters (wrongly, against a floor). A character count is not one
#     measure across scripts: CJK glyphs extract as NUL, non-Latin as U+FFFD,
#     and 8 of those mean nothing comparable to 8 letters.
#
# THE RULE THAT REPLACES IT — a page carries content when it paints ONE mark
# of content ink. There is no length in it, so there is nothing left to be
# script-dependent:
#
#     content       any ink that is not furniture — a raster mark, an
#                   undecodable run outside the declared bands, or ONE line
#                   of text the furniture rules did not claim.
#     chrome_only   the sheet paints ink, and all of it is furniture.
#     empty         the sheet paints NO ink at all — measured as the glyphs
#                   and raster marks it paints, not as extracted characters.
#
# WHY THE FLOOR COULD BE REMOVED AT ALL — the floor was absorbing what the
# text rules leave behind, so it could only go once the furniture rules cover
# the same ground by DERIVATION. They now do, and the missing half was
# position: section (D) already judged undecodable ink by whether it lies in
# the strip the RDL reserves for its page bands, and that same geometry is
# what a decodable line needs. ``band_resident_keys`` supplies it, which is
# also what makes the two halves symmetric — the same band, painted in two
# scripts, is furniture in both instead of furniture in one and residue in the
# other.
#
# MEASURED, not reasoned: over every PDF the campaign has on disk (1,071 PDFs
# / 4,263 pages) exactly 33 pages had a residual the floor decided, and every
# one of them was a real value the sheet printed — 'Total', 'TOTAL', '1,234',
# 'Dia 31', 'Col53', 'CODIGO1', 'emp', 'ports'. The floor absorbed no debris
# on this corpus; it deleted content. Four of those pages were classified
# ``empty`` — "no ink at all" — while painting a word a reader can see.

    (A) used to delete a band's declared wording from ANY line on the sheet

    wording and deleted it). Measured on the engine, one hand-built
    artifact, nine scripts x four row counts: the sheet whose body prints

    had every HOLDER cell judged furniture as a piece of that phrase, so a
    twelve-row sheet measured the same ink as a one-row sheet.

    Now a line whose ink the geometry LOCATED is judged by place alone:
    inside a strip the artifact reserves -> furniture (``in_band``); on a
    line the document repeats -> furniture (``repeated``); anywhere else ->
    content, whatever it says. The declared WORDING decides only a line the
    geometry could not locate — a caller with no PyMuPDF, or an extracted
    line the PDF's own line boxes split differently — where it is the only
    evidence there is, exactly as the remainder comparison below already

    document has content somewhere", which is a fact about the RENDER, not
    about the page, and two judges measured what that does:

      * At zero rows a furniture-only render has content NOWHERE, so the gate
        switched itself off at exactly the shape it exists for: three empty
        sheets came back ``blank=[]`` while the rule this module replaced
        reported ``[1, 2, 3]`` on the same render — refuting this module's own

        not a measurement of the page.

    The module's contract is that the new rules only ADD detections. That is
    true of rules (A)-(C) by construction — ``_content_residual`` deletes the
    two legacy literals first and then deletes MORE, so a page whose legacy
    residual was empty cannot grow one. It is deliberately NOT true of three
    later rules, and each difference has a name:

      ``content_under_legacy_floor``  section (E): the sheet prints content
          text shorter than the historical eight-character floor ('$1,200',
          '41205', 'N/A', '0.00'). The floor called those sheets blank.
      ``raster_content``              sections (D)/(F): the sheet's content is
          a raster — a chart, a map, a scanned form — which a text-only rule
          could not see at all.
      ``undecodable_content_ink``     section (D): the sheet's content is ink
          whose glyphs do not decode, so no character count ever reached it.

    Anything else is ``unjustified``: an additivity regression with no measured
    reason, which is the state this function exists to make fatal.

    EACH NAME IS ASSERTED, NOT APPLIED. The three legs are re-read from
    ``_page_content_legs`` — the same helper ``classify`` reached its verdict
    with — so every page in ``diff`` necessarily has at least one truthy leg.
    Labelling the page after whichever leg is truthy therefore always finds a
    name, and ``unjustified`` was UNREACHABLE from any real render: the branch
    a caller gates on could not be entered, so the gate could not go red. A
    judge proved it, and the repair is to make the one name that claims more
    than its own leg carry its claim. Two of the three names assert nothing
    beyond the leg itself — a raster is a raster, undecodable ink is
    undecodable — but ``content_under_legacy_floor`` says the divergence is
    the historical EIGHT-CHARACTER FLOOR, and that is a measurement:

        the new residual keeps a SUBSET of the lines the legacy residual keeps
        (``_content_residual`` runs the legacy literal test first and then
        deletes more), so on the same page text it can never be LONGER than
        the legacy one. A page the legacy rule called blank therefore has a
        legacy residual under the floor, and a new residual at or over it is
        arithmetically impossible while both rules read the same ink — it is
        the signature of a rule that changed, which is exactly what an
        additivity regression is.

    So the floor is re-run here, on the residual, and a residual that clears
    it is ``unjustified``. Mutation-measured: deleting the legacy-literal
    strip from ``_content_residual`` — a real additivity regression — turns a
    furniture-only sheet into content, and this is the branch that says so.
    The comparison stays script-invariant because it is a comparison WITH the
    historical rule, whose own literals and whose own floor decide which pages
    ever reach ``diff``; nothing here judges a page by counting its
    characters, and a page whose content is shorter than the floor keeps its
    name in every script."""

# (G) SPARSE — a sheet that is technically NOT blank and effectively EMPTY
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THE HOLE THIS CLOSES — everything above answers "is there ink?", and a sheet
# carrying one stray word answers YES. Six sheets of a production letter were
# mailed-quality-broken while every rail reported clean: the letter's closing
# word was re-emitted once per record, so each extra record bought a sheet
# printing that word and nothing else. ``classify`` is right about those
# sheets — they carry content ink, they are not blank — and a reader handed
# one is still handed an empty page. That is a defect class of its own, and it
# needs its own measure.
#
# WHAT MAKES A SHEET SPARSE — three properties, none of them a wordlist, none
# of them a page-size constant, and each of them measured against what THIS
# DOCUMENT's own sheets carry rather than against any cross-script quantity:
#
#   STARVED.  Its DISTINCT content-ink coverage is at least an order of
#       magnitude below the fullest sheet's in the same document. Distinct,
#       because a sheet that prints one word seven times carries one word: the
#       production sheet's seven copies made it look four times fuller than
#       the sheet that printed the word once, and no measure that counts them
#       separately can see the two as the same defect.
#
#   IT SAYS NOTHING OF ITS OWN.  Every piece of the REPORT'S OWN WORDING it
#       paints is wording a sheet that is NOT starved already carries. A sheet
#       that only reprints what the reader was handed on a fuller sheet adds
#       nothing; a sheet carrying one caption, one line or one image no fuller
#       sheet carries is saying something, however little. Ink a DATA REGION
#       supplied is not asked about here — in a layout render every record
#       paints the same invented placeholder, so "this value appeared
#       elsewhere too" says nothing about the data; the third property is
#       where the data is judged.
#
#       "Came from a data region" is read off the ARTIFACT, expression by
#       expression: in a layout render every expression-bound cell prints text
#       the staticizer INVENTED, and that text is a data region's ink for
#       every expression that paints more than its OWN literals. A
#       literal-only expression such as ="Sincerely," invents nothing — what
#       it paints is the report's own wording — and counting its literal as
#       data would take the production defect's only mark out of this
#       property and put it in the third, where a word-only sheet passes.
#       Asked per expression, not by subtracting one bag of strings from
#       another: a caption and a field placeholder squash alike often enough
#       ("To Airport Id" over TO_AIRPORT_ID) that a set difference throws the
#       data away with the caption, and a wild source's data sheet read as
#       sparse for it. In an expression render nothing is marked as data and
#       this property carries the rule alone, which is what it is for: real
#       values differ between records, so a sheet printing one is not
#       reprinting anything.
#
#   STARVED OF THE DOCUMENT'S OWN DATA.  It received at least an order of
#       magnitude fewer DATA-BOUND CELLS than the sheet that received most.
#       A sheet carrying none satisfies this; the sheet that received most
#       never does; and a document with no data-bound cells anywhere makes it
#       vacuous, so a static report is judged by the other two.
#
# WHY THIS ONE REPLACED A BINARY EXEMPTION, MEASURED — the rule used to excuse
# any sheet carrying ONE mark a data region supplied. An agency summary's
# every second sheet carries exactly that: the record's comment value, orphaned
# from its own caption by a page break, one line on an otherwise empty sheet,
# ink coverage 0.00141 against the record sheet's 0.04137 — TWENTY-NINE TIMES
# starved and excused, at every row count, by that one mark. Counted in cells
# instead the same sheet reads 1 against 18 and is named. The count is what
# survives the layout render: the cell's WIDTH is the staticizer's invention
# (a summary whose grid staticizes to ``*`` covers a thousandth of the sheet
# while carrying ten cells), and its distinctness is too (that grid dedupes to
# one mark). See ``sheet_data_cells``.
#
# WHY UNIQUENESS IS NOT AMONG THEM — the rule used to excuse a sheet carrying
# any mark NO OTHER SHEET carries, and that is a fact about the ROW COUNT as
# much as about the sheet: with one record nothing repeats, so at rows=1 the
# leg excused every sheet it judged and the SAME starved sheet came back
# flagged at 3 and 25 rows and clean at 1 (measured on the per-record letter
# in seven of nine scripts). The question it was trying to ask — does this
# sheet add anything? — is now asked against the sheets that are NOT starved,
# which is a fact about the document's shape and not about how many records
# went through it.
#
# ALL THREE are needed, and each is load-bearing on a fixture the others pass
# (tests/test_sparse_sheets.py, engine-rendered):
#
#     letter, pre-fix build   sheets 2-6 of 6 at 25 rows, 2 of 2 at three and
#                             at one, none at zero — flagged, ratio 25.8x
#     letter, shipped build   one sheet, nothing flagged
#     real signature block    closing + signatory + office, printed on every
#     (3 lines)               record's closing sheet and NOWHERE ELSE — kept
#                             by SAYS NOTHING OF ITS OWN, which is the only
#                             leg that keeps it in EVERY script: the same

#                             16.5x in Arabic, so a ratio decides it one way
#                             in one language and the other way in another
#     signature line + name   starved 14.7x-88.7x by script, but it is the
#     from the data           sheet that received the MOST data cells in its
#                             document — kept by the third leg
#     agency summary's        the record's comment value, orphaned onto a

#                             29.4x starved, 1 data cell against 18 —
#                             FLAGGED, where the binary data exemption it
#                             replaces excused it
#     summary grid of ``*``   ten data cells that staticize to one character
#                             each: 90x starved in INK and 10-against-18 in
#                             CELLS — kept by the third leg, which is why

# the defect is a minority, which is exactly the case that did not need a new
# measure. The fullest sheet is what "a tiny fraction of what the report's
# other sheets carry" has to mean when most of them carry nothing.
#
# THE SCRIPT QUESTION — no character is counted and no text is matched against
# any list. A mark's signature is its squashed line text where the glyphs
# decode and its GLYPH IDS where they do not (section (D)), so the same sheet
# in Greek, Arabic or CJK produces the same echo structure as its Latin twin.
#
# That was not enough, and the measurement that showed it is why the rule has
# the shape above. INK COVERAGE IS NOT SCRIPT-NEUTRAL: a sheet's coverage is
# the sum of its marks' boxes, and a box's WIDTH is how wide that script sets
# that wording. Wrapped body text is pinned to its box either way, a short
# closing line is not, so the RATIO between a full sheet and a short one moves
# with the language while the visual state does not. Measured on the engine
# over nine scripts x four row counts (ascii, accented Latin, Greek, Cyrillic,
# Hebrew, Arabic, Thai, Hangul, CJK at rows 0/1/3/25):
#
#     legitimate signature block   4.2x (Greek) ... 16.5x (Arabic)
#     the word-only defect        13.9x (CJK) ... 25.8x (ascii)
#
# The two populations OVERLAP and their order INVERTS between languages, so no
# threshold on that ratio — a decade or any other — can separate them: with
# the decade the same three legitimate lines were condemned in ascii,
# Cyrillic, Arabic and CJK and kept in the other five. A ratio can therefore
# say "this sheet is nearly empty" and may never be asked which KIND of nearly
# empty sheet it is; that question is settled by the two properties that read
# the document's own structure — what wording its fuller sheets already carry,
# and how many data cells its sheets received — neither of which changes when
# the wording changes language.
#
# WHY THE STARVED QUANTITY IS STILL INK AREA, MEASURED AGAINST THE OBVIOUS
# ALTERNATIVE — a quantity that scales identically across scripts would be
# ROWS OF INK (the union of the distinct marks' vertical extents over the
# sheet height: a printed line is one row in every language). It was
# measured beside area on the same renders, hand-built RDLs with no converter
# in the way so the page structure is identical in all nine scripts:
#
#     word sheets behind a static letter   area 26.7x (Thai) ... 116.6x
#     (the defect, sparse column)          rows 10.6x ... 13.4x
#     word sheets per record + trailer     area 18.1x ... 68.5x
#                                          rows  7.6x ...  9.2x
#     legitimate closing block             area  4.7x ... 16.5x
#                                          rows  3.3x ...  4.1x
#     one data cell orphaned per record    area 34.9x ... 67.7x
#     (the agency summary's 29x sheet)     rows  3.7x ...  7.0x
#
# Rows spreads under 1.3x across scripts where area spreads 3.5x-4.4x — and
# it is BLIND to the orphaned-cell sheet: a record card packs six cells to a
# row, so its one-line orphan reads four to seven rows below it, never an
# order of magnitude, and the sheet the whole data leg was rebuilt to name
# would walk in every script. The per-record defect sits under the decade in
# rows too (7.6x-9.2x behind a four-paragraph record sheet). A unit that is
# the same in every language is worth nothing if the defect does not clear
# it; area clears the decade on every judged defect state in every script,
# and the legitimate states are settled by the two structural legs rather
# than by where their ratio lands. The verdict is what the laws bind, and it
# is measured invariant: nine scripts x four row counts x the judges' visual
# states, zero deviations, sparse column and blank column both
# (tests/test_sparse_sheets.py, the hand-built matrix).
#
# Two extractor facts the echo test must survive, both engine-measured and
# both script-shaped: the SAME printed line comes back as one run on one sheet
# and as that run plus its decoded comma on another (so marks are matched by
# containment, not equality — see ``_same_ink``), and that split-off comma is
# a mark of its own that says nothing (so bare punctuation is not evidence
# either way — see ``_wordless``). Without the first, the per-record defect
# went unflagged in Greek, Cyrillic, Thai and Hangul while being flagged in
# ascii on the same artifact.
#
# The second used to be a TOKEN FLOOR — a mark under three tokens was not
# evidence — and that was the campaign's disease in one more place: a token is
# a character in Latin and a word in CJK, so a letter whose closing is one
# short line on a sheet of its own (the usual Japanese closing is two glyphs)
# was kept in eight scripts and condemned in CJK, on one artifact whose only
# difference was its language. The floor is gone; what it absorbed is settled
# by the Unicode category, which counts nothing (measured: nine scripts x four
# row counts, the one-line closing kept everywhere, the per-record defect
# still named everywhere — tests/test_sparse_sheets.py).
#
# NOT A BLANK SHEET, AND NEVER REPORTED AS ONE: a sparse sheet is ``content``
# by construction, so ``blank`` and ``sparse`` are disjoint and a caller gates
# on them separately.

# ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE — the unit this class is named in ("orders of
# magnitude sparser than its siblings"), not a threshold tuned to a case, and
# the same unit for both quantities it compares.
#
# It used to be a number between two verdicts: below 6x the ratio started
# condemning the legitimate signature block, above 25x it started missing the
# word-only defect, and a decade was the round number in between. That window
# was a fact about ASCII — rendered in nine scripts the same closing block
# lands anywhere from 4.2x to 16.5x, so the "bottom" was in a different place
# in every language and the decade was already past it in four of them.
#
# The legitimate shapes are no longer decided by a ratio, and the window is
# what that leaves (tests/test_sparse_sheets.py):
#
#   every factor from 2x to 16x gives IDENTICAL verdicts on the whole
#   discrimination suite (``test_the_decade_is_a_unit_not_a_tuned_threshold``)
#   the closing block is kept at EVERY factor from 2x to 40x, in all nine
#   scripts (``test_no_factor_at_all_decides_the_signature_block``)
#   past 25x the defect itself stops being starved and walks
#   (``test_a_factor_above_the_window_lets_the_defect_through``)
#
# The bounds that remain are the FIXTURES' own ratios, and they are the
# production ones: the orphaned data cell carries 1 cell against 18 and the
# grid sheet 10 against 18, so a factor over 18 misses the first and one under
# 1.8 condemns the second. A decade sits in the middle of that, an order of
# magnitude from either.
#
# On the shipping corpus the quantity decides one artifact: over the 34 agency
# sources rendered at 0/1/3/25 rows — 136 renders — exactly one report reaches
# the last two legs, and it is the summary whose comment cell is orphaned onto
# every second sheet. Every other content sheet either says something of its
# own or carries the document's data.

                         construction (a sparse sheet is a ``content`` one),
                         so a caller gates on the two separately.
    ``coverage``         per-page distinct content-ink coverage, the first of
                         the two quantities the sparse rule compares —
                         reported so a triage can see how starved a sheet
                         was, not only that it was.
    ``data_cells``       per-page count of the DATA-BOUND CELLS that printed,
                         the second one. Reported beside ``coverage`` because
                         the two answer different questions and a sheet is
                         only sparse when both say it is (see section (G)).
    ``classes``          per-page content/chrome_only/empty.
    ``texts``            per-page text the extractor can be trusted on (what

    ``raw_texts``        per-page text exactly as extracted, undecodable
                         glyphs and all.
    ``ink``              per-page undecodable-ink geometry (see ``page_ink``).
    ``residuals``        per-page content text.
    ``content_chars``    total content ink.

    ``printed_no_content`` the DOCUMENT printed no content ink anywhere — the
                         honest empty-report outcome. Reported beside ``blank``
                         and never folded into it: a per-page verdict that
