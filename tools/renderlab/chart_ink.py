"""PLOTTED-INK measure for engine-rendered charts.

A generated <Chart> can pass every structural gate -- XSD-valid, the right
Type and Subtype, the right value expression -- and still print an EMPTY AXIS
FRAME: title, axes, gridlines and tick labels with nothing plotted between
them. That is exactly what the render harness produced for every chart before
the staticizer learned to keep simple aggregate <Y> values, and no gate in the
suite could tell the two apart, because both are "a chart that rendered".

This measure separates them, from the rendered PDF itself.

  * An SSRS chart is rasterised into the PDF as ONE image placed at exactly
    the Width x Height its <Chart> declares, so chart images can be told from
    the rest by that box alone (measured: a 5.44in x 3.06in chart against a
    1.41in x 0.38in letterhead image in the same render). Charts print in the
    order the body declares them, so the k-th chart-sized image down the
    document is the k-th declared chart.
  * Axes, gridlines, tick labels and titles are BLACK or GRAY -- max(r,g,b)
    equals min(r,g,b) up to antialiasing. Plotted marks (bars, slices, areas,
    the line) carry the palette's COLOUR. Chromatic pixels are plotted ink.

Two things are measured about that ink, because one is not enough:

  SPREAD -- the fraction of image COLUMNS holding at least one chromatic
    pixel. The AMOUNT of colour does not separate plotted from empty: a thin
    line series covers 0.08% of its image while an emptied chart that still
    draws a LEGEND covers 1.2% (both measured). Spread does: plotted marks run
    across the plot area, a legend swatch stands in one narrow column.

  COLOURS -- the number of dominant chromatic colours (quantized to 8 levels
    per channel, each holding >=2% of the chromatic pixels), which must reach
    the number of ChartSeries the chart declares. Spread alone has one
    measured blind spot: emptied of its values, a PERCENT-STACKED AREA chart
    is painted by the engine as one solid full-width band, indistinguishable
    by spread from the real thing (0.73 coverage either way). Its colours give
    it away -- two declared series plot two colours, the empty band has one.

Measured over fixture charts covering every mapped graph family (column plain
/ stacked / percent, horizontal bar plain and stacked, line, area plain /
stacked / percent, pie, ring, and the neutral fallback), rendered through the
MS engine, against the same charts with their <Y> values emptied:

    plotted      coverage 0.483 .. 0.720   colours == declared series
    emptied      coverage 0.000 .. 0.053   except the percent-stacked area
                                           band (0.730) -- 1 colour, 2 series

so the spread gate sits at 0.25: about half the weakest real chart and about
five times the strongest empty one.

LIMITS, stated rather than hidden. (1) This measures COLOURED plotted ink, so
a graph rendered in an all-gray palette would read as empty; every stock SSRS
palette is chromatic, and the custom palette is built from the colours the
Oracle <Series color=..> declarations name. (2) A series whose values are all
zero plots no colour of its own; the render harness synthesises non-zero rows.
