"""Painted-over text detector for ENGINE-RENDERED output.

The mockup gates measure the browser preview; the layout auditor measures
RDL geometry. Neither measures what Microsoft's engine actually PRINTS —
and that gap shipped a grant-status grid whose contact block was painted
straight over its column headers while every other rail reported clean.

This rail closes the gap at the last surface there is: the rendered PDF.
Words are extracted with their bounding boxes (PyMuPDF); two words from
DIFFERENT text blocks whose boxes materially intersect mean one piece of
text is printed on top of another — a defect no data shape can excuse.

    from render_overlap import pdf_overlaps, rdl_overlaps
    bad = pdf_overlaps("out.pdf")     # -> [ {page, a, b, area}, ... ]

Tuning notes, learned against real renders:
- The intersection must cover >=30% of the smaller word's box AND at
  least half the shorter word's height. Kerning, italic overhang, tight
  leading, and a section band touching a tiny one-letter word all graze;
  a painted-over word shares the line.
- There is deliberately NO same-block exemption. MuPDF groups text by
  REGION, so two textboxes stamped dead-centre on the same spot -- the
  worst possible defect -- land in one block; an exemption made exactly
  that case invisible (mutation-proofing caught it before it shipped).
- Underlines/rules are not words and never flag.

# RULES THROUGH GLYPHS
#
# The word-pair scan above is text-vs-text by construction, so a DRAWN rule
# cutting through printed characters is invisible to it: a voucher grid came
# back paint=0 while every caption in it had the neighbouring value box's
# border sliced through the last letters (crop-verified). Underlines, cell
# borders and table rules are legitimate and common, so the discriminator is
# purely geometric + paint-order:
#
#   * the rule must be VISIBLE — a stroke an opaque fill covers afterwards
#     prints nothing (measured: a section band's own frame edge is stamped
#     first, then the band fill paints over it, then the caption; the pixels
#     show no rule at all);
#   * a HORIZONTAL rule must land inside the glyph CORE — below the cap line
#     and above the baseline. Underlines sit at or under the baseline and
#     overlines above the cap line, so neither can ever flag;
#   * a VERTICAL rule must land strictly INSIDE one character's ink box with
#     clearance on both sides, so a cell border abutting the text box edge,
#     or grazing the side bearing of the first/last glyph, does not flag;
#   * measurement is per CHARACTER (rawdict char boxes), never per word box:
#     a word box spans the inter-letter gaps, and a rule in a gap prints
#     between letters, not through them.
